## Project Overview

This project implements three algorithms in C++ that together demonstrate the analysis and processing of a context-free grammar and its corresponding Push Down Automata (PDA). The grammar used is:

> **G:**  
> **S ‚Üí aSb | Œµ**

The assignment is divided into three parts:

1. **Algorithm 1:**  
   - Generates strings that belong to the language defined by the grammar (accepted strings) and strings that do not belong, using the same alphabet {a, b}.  
   - The generated strings are displayed and stored in the file `Cadenas_generadas.txt`.

2. **Algorithm 2:**  
   - Implements a PDA that recognizes strings generated by the grammar G.  
   - The PDA processes the input symbol by symbol, managing a stack (push for 'a', pop for 'b') and records each configuration.  
   - Accepted strings are stored in the file `Cadenas_aceptadas.txt`.  
   - The transitions are detailed and the summary of configurations is printed in a structured format.

3. **Algorithm 3:**  
   - Reads the accepted strings from `Cadenas_aceptadas.txt` and builds a detailed table showing a leftmost derivation of each string along with the corresponding PDA configurations.  
   - The table is displayed in three columns:
     - **Column 1:** The production rule applied
     - **Column 2:** The sentential form obtained after the rule application.
     - **Column 3:** The PDA configuration in the form *(q, Stack, Remaining Input)*

The  (`Main.cpp`) integrates the three algorithms, running them sequentially without any user input. All output is shown in a single console window.

## How to Compile and Run the Project ‚ùì

1. **Preparation:**
   - Place all source files (`ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_MM_SA.cpp`, `ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_MM_SA.cpp`, `ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_MM_SA.cpp`, and `Main.cpp`) in the same directory.
   - Ensure that no extra files or directories are included in the submission.

2. **Compilation:**
   - Open your command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
   - Compile the project by running:
     ```
     g++ Main.cpp -o SimulacionPDA.exe
     ```
     (Since `Main.cpp` includes the other source files, compiling this single file is enough.)

3. **Execution:**
   - After successful compilation, run the executable:
     ```
     .\SimulacionPDA.exe
     ```
   - The program will run automatically without requiring any user input.
   - **The important output will be displayed on the console**, and two extra files will be generated, which were only for the purposes of the internal execution of the program:
     - `Cadenas_generadas.txt` ‚Äì containing all generated strings.
     - `Cadenas_aceptadas.txt` ‚Äì containing only the strings accepted by the PDA.
